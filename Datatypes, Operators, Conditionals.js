ASSIGNMENT RULES
- All the answers must be written in JavaScript
- You can ask for help, reach the Teaching Assistants if needed
- You can Google / use StackOverflow BUT only when you think you need something we didn't cover during lessons yet
- You can test your code in a separate file or de-commenting the single exercises in this one.
- You can use the bash terminal, the VSCode terminal or the one embedded in your Operating System if you're using macOS or Linux.
- The solution must be available for the tutors by the end of the day (5PM CET)
*/

/* EXERCISE 1
 Enumerate and describe the main datatypes in JavaScript. Try to explain the concepts as you were speaking to a 12 years old.
*/

/* Number, string, boolean, null, undefined. Number is used to represent a value number, string is used to code a statement where you intend to write in words, boolean is where giving you the results of true or false, null is basically used as empty, undefined is sort of similar to null where no value is given but mainly is by JS */

/* EXERCISE 2
 Try to describe what a variable is, in your own words.
*/

/* Variable is a value that be tailored or changed according to needs of the conditions */

/* EXERCISE 3
 Write the code to execute an addition (a sum) of the numbers 12 and 20.
*/

/* let sum = 12 + 20 */

/* EXERCISE 4
 Create a variable named x and assign to it the number 12.
*/

/* let x = 12; */

/* EXERCISE 5
 Create a variable called name and assign to it the string "John Doe".
*/

/* let fullName = "John Doe" */

/* EXERCISE 6
 Execute a subtraction between the number 12 and the variable x you declared before (which is storing the value 12).
*/

/* let x = 12
console.log (x-12) */

/* EXERCISE 7
 Create two variables: name1 and name2. Assign to name1 the string "john", and to name2 the string "John" (this one has a capital J!)
 Verify that name1 is different from name2 (HINT: check their equality to be false).
 Finally, verify that the equality between name1 and name2 becomes true if both are lowercase (without changing the value of name2).
*/

/*  let name1 = "john"
    let name2 = "John" 
    console.log(name1 === name2) 
    name2 = "john"
    console.log(name1 === name2)
    /

/* EXERCISE 8
 Create a variable named x, and assign to it a numeric value less than 10.
 Write the code to print the literal value of x (ex.: if x is 1, it should print "one", if x is 5 it should print "five" etc.).
*/

/* let x = 9;
console.log(x) */

/* EXERCISE 9
 [Extra] Assign a value to a variable using a ternary operator (this topic has not been covered during lesson yet,
 try to search it by yourself, tomorrow morning we'll discuss it together!)
*/

/* function freeEntrance(isKid)  {
    return(isKid ? "free": "$10")}
    console.log(freeEntrance(true));
    console.log(freeEntrance(false));
    console.log(freeEntrance(null));
